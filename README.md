# Numerical-Quadrature_using_free-form-FORTRAN
Numerical solution of definite integration using an adaptive method based on the trapezoidal rule.
The core solution subroutines are included in "MODULE numerical_quadrature".
As an example, a test program named "PROGRAM_test_quadrature" illustrates how to use the subroutines included in
the "MODULE numerical_quadrature".
There are also a couple of functions f(x)=1.0/x and f(x)=cos(x) as an example.
